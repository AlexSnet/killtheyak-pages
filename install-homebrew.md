os: [macosx]
description: Homebrew's tagline is "the missing package manager for OS X". It is by far the best package manager for Mac available and will save you hours of yak-shaving.

Works on all MacOSX >= 10.5.

```bash
# In your Mac Terminal, run:
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
```

Thats it!
